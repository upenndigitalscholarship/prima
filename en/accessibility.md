# Accessibility

PRIMA strives to meet the needs of all site users. Our content is available in multiple formats and offers accessibility tools like dual language subtitles, transcripts, and answer keys. PRIMA learners who use screen readers are encouraged to download worksheet pdfs for greatest site legibility. Those using smaller electronic devices such as cellphones will have greatest ease with the site by accessing the activities and media on separate pages.

Users can reach learning materials by clicking on the “Browse Media” or “Lesson Index” buttons located in the navigation bar at the top of the site. “Browse Media” allows users to filter content based on learning level, media type, or general practice targets: reading, vocabulary, grammar, or writing. Searching via the “Lesson Index” tab allows users to search by grammar of vocabulary learning objectives, and functions more like a typical book index.  

<ins>SITE:</ins>  
The layout of the site is intentionally designed to meet the needs of both learners and instructors. Those with a more grammar-specific focus are encouraged to search the site using the index feature, while those looking for media-type or level based content may choose the “browse media” feature and select their desired filters.  

The site is completely bilingual to meet users where they are most linguistically comfortable, and should be easily navigable from all devices with internet access.  

<ins>ACTIVITIES:</ins>
On each activity page, users can choose from worksheets available as a “docx” or “pdf.” The word document is a better option for those wanting to modify the document for their classroom to make it more suitable to certain textbooks or teaching styles. Documents have also been formatted with heading styles to best suit those using screen readers.  

Each activity worksheet is available in Italian (with instructions in Italian) on the Italian version of the site and English (with instructions in English) on the English version; this allows users with different linguistic abilities to access the version of the materials with which they are most comfortable. You can find the language toggle at the top right of your screen.  

An answer key pdf accompanies each activity: users should keep in mind that some activities are open ended to allow for linguistic creativity.

<ins>SUBTITLES AND TRANSCRIPTS:</ins>
English and Italian transcripts are available for each video so users can read along with the video or visit the text at a later time.

Subtitles are available in both Italian and English which also include closed-captioning when integral to the plot for hard-of-hearing viewers. In many cases, we have translated from the Italian ourselves and paid special attention to cultural and linguistic differences.  

Users can toggle on English or Italian subtitles for all videos.
