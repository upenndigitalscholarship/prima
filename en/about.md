<h2> About </h2>

PRIMA (Pedagogical Repository of Italian Media Activities) is a language learning tool meant to supplement grammar books and other resources designed for Italian language learning. Our collection began as a collection of worksheets used in Italian language classrooms at the University of Pennsylvania. It was a direct response to the lack of diversity (both in content and in representation) provided in conventional language learning materials. We wanted to expand our teaching materials and be able to share these resources with others so that they wouldn’t have to “reinvent the wheel” as we felt we kept having to do. 

Our goal was to compile a series of videos and accompanying activities that any Italian instructor could use to complement their curriculum. Our objectives were to gather media and create content that promoted diverse voices, was multi-modal, inclusive, and accessible for all contemporary language learners. 

In February 2020, thanks to a grant from the Penn Language Center we were able to get the project off the ground. Since then, thanks to the resources and invaluable minds of our growing team, PRIMA has grown to be an Open Education Resource for both language instructors and language learners. As we continue to contribute new content to this repository we also invite other Italian instructors to join us by submitting their own content to be shared on the platform. 

<h3> Using the Site </h3>


The activities on this site span all levels from beginner to advanced, and range in focus from grammatical topics, reading and listening comprehension, vocabulary, and culture. All the activities focus on language and cultural learning through engagement with a piece of authentic Italian media (from film clips and music videos to short stories). The media file and accompanying worksheets can be accessed from any device with an Internet connection, and worksheets may be downloaded and modified according to their intended use. There are accompanying answer keys, captions, and transcripts designed to cater to the specific needs of each user. 

Instructors using PRIMA can search by specific learning objectives, types of media, or level and are encouraged to modify, adapt, and adopt as many resources as fit within the scope of their courses. Italian Language Learners may choose to follow clips according to level and follow the pre-designed learning course laid out by the various units within each level category, or may choose to focus on a desired learning goal or favorite media type. 

All users who know what they want are encouraged to use the search function to reach their content most directly, and those just looking to have fun with language learning are also invited to click on the “surprise me” button which will select activities at random (a tool especially useful for those who want to brush up on content or flex their language learning muscles). 
By using activities from our repository, instructors are helping students to fill in the gaps where the curriculum often falls short in terms of popular culture and other contemporary subjects. It is crucial that students are exposed to Italians of color, queer Italians, and those belonging to non-traditional or minority communities, as textbooks do not often represent (or poorly represent) non-white or non-heteronormative Italians. PRIMA gives students a broader and more accurate perspective of contemporary Italy that reflects the country’s vibrancy and celebrates the achievements of ALL Italians.
