1
00:00:00,121 --> 00:00:06,671
My name is Kevin Javier and I was born here 
in Italy and my parents are of Filipino origin.

2
00:00:06,763 --> 00:00:09,830
My name is Anastasio Moten. I was born in Parma...

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,434
...province of Padua, in a small town called Ponso.

4
00:00:13,616 --> 00:00:18,557
I am of Indian origin. At noon, I cook a bit of 
Italian food. For dinner we eat Indian food.

5
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:26,452
...sweet polenta, polenta with rabbit, polenta with braised meat. I mean, on Sunday, polenta is typical of Bergamo, right?

6
00:00:26,615 --> 00:00:33,453
I feel Italian, even though I don't have citizenship, but the simple fact is that I've been here since I was three years old.

7
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:37,465
So if I don't feel Italian, what should I feel like?

8
00:00:37,535 --> 00:00:42,330
I'm on the bus, maybe I'm talking to a friend of mine, to someone, maybe on the phone, after a while they turn around.

9
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:45,547
“Ah but... oh wow... you're black?”

10
00:00:45,638 --> 00:00:52,370
The compliment that I get  is, “Oh, you speak 
Italian so well!” And I reply, “You, too!”

11
00:00:52,371 --> 00:01:00,501
Since I'm not an Italian citizen, I should always have these things with me: my residence permit, issued on June 27, 2008.

12
00:01:00,771 --> 00:01:07,860
It expires on October 29, 2010 and it arrived to me in August 
of 2010. I could basically take this one and throw it away.

13
00:01:08,218 --> 00:01:14,949
And I have to walk around with this, which is the postal receipt, the classic receipt of registered letters of postal packages.

14
00:01:15,248 --> 00:01:21,027
It's a bulletin. I have to walk around with these, 
a substitute for a residence permit.

15
00:01:21,505 --> 00:01:26,448
If I don't always have these, I risk being taken to 
the police station and maybe being put in a cell.

16
00:01:26,568 --> 00:01:34,432
When I say “I have a residence permit,” people are amazed 
and they say to me “Why?” like, “Don't you have citizenship?”

17
00:01:34,474 --> 00:01:40,925
I am still not an Italian citizen. I understood this 
whole thing about citizenship in the ninth grade.

18
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,985
I had the opportunity to participate in a selection for Nationals.

19
00:01:48,046 --> 00:01:52,087
Even if they chose me, I couldn't be part 
of it for the mere fact that I'm not Italian.

20
00:01:52,397 --> 00:02:02,136
At 18, I would have liked to do service, enroll in the army and go somewhere, but unfortunately I couldn't  and I still can't.

21
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:07,582
It says, “Born at Nigeria.” In correct Italian, 
however, it should be “Born IN Nigeria,”

22
00:02:07,678 --> 00:02:10,004
and anyway I wasn't born in Nigeria, I was born in Rome.
